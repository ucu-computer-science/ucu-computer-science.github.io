## Legend

The most important thing is - the CODE of a subject and year.
If the project is valid also for the next year - the correspondent tag should be added.

`XX[X]2023` - XX[X] can be POC/ACS/OS/C++ - a correspondent tag to simplify search and management.

- `LTC` - **Long Term Continuous** - Projects are divided into multiple parts and last over a year. UCU alumni usually mentor them. It can be done by multiple teams, not necessary to complete the whole project.
- `DL` - **Discrete Logic** - Forbidden to use MCU, but any chips of 74хх or 4000 series are allowed. MCU can be used for testing only.
- `MCU` - **Micro Controller Unit** - Allowed using STM32, CyPress PSoC, TI Tiva or other ARM Cortex M MCUs. AVR8 (Arduino) or ARM Cortex-A (Raspberry Pi-like) are forbidden.
- `SCI` - **Scientific** - Research projects. Requires the formal report in scientific form. The participants in a conference are preferable.
- `MCU-M` - **Methodological** - Easy projects for students who are mostly uninterested in the subject. It should be completely alone.
  Complexity:
- `X` - **eXtreme** - a new project with unknown complexity and if it is even possible to complete.
- `E` - **Experimental** - Mentors may have some experiments, but it was never done with other students. It could be not very easy.
- `N` - **Normal** - nontrivial, but average complexity.
- `S` - **Simple** - for those not interested in the subject. Simple does not mean boring.

## Requirements

- The project should be done in teams of maximum 4 people (if other is not specified).
- For DL/MCU projects, the condition is a working device implementing the given task. For MCU-M projects - working examples are needed.
- The device should have a schematic diagram, the code, and instructions on "how to use", also all implementation choices should be justified - why the particular scheme, elements were chosen etc.
- Every team member should have a report regarding his impact on the overall result and how the teamwork was organised. **ATTENTION!** Every team member should take participant in the project defence.
- At least every two weeks team should report the progress to the mentor. The best would be to do it during the consultations. Missing reports can cause lower grades.
- It is possible to extend and change the project or even collaborate with other teams unless it does not violate the main task.
- It is possible to complete the project before the semester if it is properly done (for example, during the summer).
