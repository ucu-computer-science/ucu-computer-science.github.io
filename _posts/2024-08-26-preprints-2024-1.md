## Preface 

### By the scientific editor

During the computer engineering courses of the [Faculty of Applied Science of Ukrainian Catholic University](https://apps.ucu.edu.ua/en/), which I am responsible for, students perform course projects. Most projects are mentored by highly skilled experts from the Academy and Industry. For many years, I have been impressed by their quality and deepness. Two years ago, as a part of academic writing and coherent storytelling practice, I introduced the requirement to write a report in the form of an IEEE conference paper. And I then noticed that, sometimes, their reports are on par with conference papers. So, the idea of this preprint collection – the proceedings of our courses, was born.

Those courses are: “Computer Organization Basics” (POC), “Architecture of the Computers” (AKS), “Operating Systems” (OS), and “Modern C++,” so the topics of the projects are very broad: from the hardware design and characterization to the development of renderers, from neural networks optimization to the general relativity related problems modeling. However, they are connected to either developing the hardware, squeezing most from the existing hardware – so-called high-performance computing, or teaching all the mentioned.

Due process was used to select works for publication, and an anonymous peer review was performed. Each work was reviewed by at least two persons, selected among the students of our faculty, who were competent in the corresponding topics. Then, each paper was read and, if necessary, edited by Anastasiia Beheni, the editor-in-chief of the collection, and me.

In addition to the high-quality preprints, we decided to add Purgatory – a collection of the often not less interesting works, though with substantial problems and authors unwilling or unable to fix them. All of them passed the peer review, with some requests for corrections or improvements. One substantial case is the usage of illustrations from other works without citing their sources in the picture captions – authors in no way pretend they created those illustrations, and corresponding sources are mentioned in the references list – just without adhering to the proper procedure.

This project would be impossible without the students and mentors working on the projects – and the Faculty and the University, bringing all of us together; reviews: Daria Minieieva, Dmytro Shumskyi, Dzvenyslava Butynets, Iryna Kokhan, Ivan Shevchenko, Kostyantin Savorona, Mariia Ivanchenko, Marta Sumyk, Oleksandr Ivaniuk, Oles Yarish. Olesia Omelchuk, Ostap Seryvko, Petro Mozil, Roman Mutel, Serhii Ivanov, Sofiia Folvarochna, Svitlana Hovorova, Viktoriia Kocherkevych, Yaroslav Klym and last but not least, without the [Anastasiia Beheni](#by-the-editor-in-chief), who agreed to serve as a manager of the project!

Many thanks to the Ukrainian Armed Forces for making this project possible!

I hope we continue our practice for the future years of our courses.

### By the editor-in-chief 

Team projects are a huge part of studying at the Applied Science Faculty. We have them on almost every course. If these projects aren’t thought of as an obligation, they can become a playground. With the resources of UCU, students can follow their curiosity with a zero error cost (but please don’t burn all the microcontrollers). A bad grade isn’t given for trying and failing; it's given for not trying.

However, implementing a project is not the only important thing. It’s also necessary to be able to explain what has been done even to people without very specific knowledge. No matter what someone does in life, the ability to communicate ideas is major. It’s not always easy, but it’s a needed mental exercise to build discipline and clarity of mind. The clearer the thinking, the better the writing, and vice versa. That’s how the motivation for writing all those reports can be seen, and they are welcome to be read on this page.

I want to thank all the volunteers who agreed to help us review the reports. And I want to express gratitude to my teammates, Ostap, Sofiia, Olesia, and Roman, with whom we worked on two of the projects listed here and on many more. We’ve learned a lot together, and I’ve learned a lot from them. Those 3 years at the Applied Science Faculty were quite a journey for me.

I am very grateful to Ukrainian Armed Forces for the ability to live and study in Ukraine.

**Abstract**: *In recent years, machine learning has experienced an immense surge in popularity. As the accuracy of models has significantly improved, there has been a corresponding increase in the resources required to execute them. In certain scenarios, it becomes crucial to employ complex deep-learning models on embedded devices in real-time. The objective of this work is to enhance the ALIKE model's speed while minimizing any potential loss in accuracy, targeting the embedded platforms, such as a BeagleBone AI-64.*

### Development of High-Performance Methods for Modeling Gravitational Interaction on Large Scales 

**Authors**: Roman Naumenko, Anastasiia Beheni, Olesia Omelchuk, Sofiia Folvarochna, Mykhailo Moroz

**Published**: 1 September 2024. Performed in AKS-2023.

[Download the preprint in PDF.](/files/2024-08-26-preprints-2024-1/PR2024_08_work_05.pdf)

**Abstract**: *The project demonstrates the implementation of high-performance methods for modeling gravitational interaction in a dynamic system with a large number of homogeneous particles in three-dimensional space. To optimize the calculations, we approximated the task's solution using the Barnes-Hut algorithm. It groups nearby bodies and approximates them as a single body.*

*For effective parallel building of the BVH tree that minimizes divergence and maximizes occupancy, we used Linear BVH construction that first chooses the order in which the leaf nodes are stored in the tree and then generates the internal nodes in a way that respects this order. We choose that order using the space-filling z-order curve that associates each particle with the corresponding Morton code depending on its position in space. Using sorted with Bitonic sort Morton codes, we are able to build a BVH tree processing each node in parallel.*

*To maximize and utilize the possible substantial gains for the mentioned algorithms in a parallel setting, we perform all the calculations on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We used Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) and the compute shaders written in Graphics Library Shader Language (GLSL) to interact with the GPU.*

### Concurrent Real-Time Raytracer 1 

**Authors**: Andrii Yaroshevych, Pavlo Kryven, Oleksandr Shchur, Ostap Trush

**Published**: 1 September 2024. Performed in AKS-2023.

[Download the preprint in PDF.](/files/2024-08-26-preprints-2024-1/PR2024_08_work_06.pdf)

**Abstract**: *This project aimed to create a real-time ray tracer program on the CPU, utilizing the wide possibilities for parallelization. Blinn-Phong~\cite{Blinn} reflection model is used as a backbone of lighting effects. Ray-objects intersection testing is conducted using the Möller–Trumbore algorithm~\cite{moller_trumbore} for triangles and simple linear algebra operations for plains, spheres, and ellipses. Global and local view concepts are introduced to implement the 3D object sizing, rotation, and positioning. The camera obscura model is used to reproduce the properties of the camera, such as field of view and perspective. As expected, the overall conclusion is that the CPU is insufficient to perform a high-resolution real-time rendering. However, GPU rendering also had some downsides~\cite{Wald}, so the investigated problem is still relevant.*

**Abstract**: *Deep learning models often require large amounts of data to be trained effectively. Hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used to group similar data points together and reduce the amount of data required for training. However, traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms can be computationally expensive and not scalable to large datasets. In this paper, we propose DeepDendro, a parallel system designed specifically for deep learning applications. We implement DeepDendro using C++ and Intel's TBB library for parallelization. Our algorithm uses a PipeDream approach for parallel training of Neural Networks. The proposed algorithm achieves significant speedup compared to traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms while maintaining high accuracy in results.*

#### Solving a rendering equation using the Monte Carlo Method  

**Authors**: Severyn Shykula, Petro Prokopets, Mykola Vysotskyi, Nazar Tkhir, Mykhailo Moroz

**Published**: 1 September 2024. Performed in AKS-2024.

[Download the preprint in PDF.](/files/2024-08-26-preprints-2024-1/PR2024_08_draft_01.pdf)

**Abstract**: *Solving a rendering equation using the Monte Carlo method is a computational approach in computer graphics to simulate the complex process of light transport within a scene. The rendering equation describes the distribution of light in a three-dimensional environment. It accounts for how light interacts with surfaces, materials, and the surrounding medium, making it a fundamental equation in computer graphics for realistic image synthesis. The Monte Carlo method, in this context, involves using random sampling techniques to approximate the solution to the rendering equation. Instead of trying to solve the equation analytically, which can be extremely challenging due to its complexity, Monte Carlo methods rely on statistical sampling to estimate the integral of the rendering equation.*

#### Cross-platform Renderer for Volumetric Bodies with Vulkan API 

**Authors**: Roman Naumenko

**Published**: 1 September 2024. Performed in OS-2023.

[Download the preprint in PDF.](/files/2024-08-26-preprints-2024-1/PR2024_08_draft_02.pdf)

**Abstract**: *This project demonstrates the implementation of a cross-platform rendering engine, leveraging the Vulkan API's capabilities to render volumetric bodies efficiently. Building upon a foundational understanding of OpenGL, it explores Vulkan's functionality as a modern, efficient, and low-overhead graphics API. The robust application developed not only serves as a scene renderer but also supports a graphical user interface, showcasing Vulkan's versatility in complex rendering tasks. Utilizing raw Vulkan API for rendering and GLFW for window creation and OS interaction on both Windows and Linux, the project underscores Vulkan's comparative advantages over traditional APIs like OpenGL and highlights the developmental journey and learning curve associated with it.*

*To achieve high-fidelity images when rendering volumetric objects like clouds, smoke, and fog, the method of ray marching was employed. This particular method is often utilized in modern game engines for the same purpose, as it not only can produce visuals indistinguishable from reality but also possesses significant potential for optimization and parallelization. This allows it to operate efficiently on GPUs and be executed exclusively in the fragment shader.*

#### CCTV Camera Software Customization for Precise Frame Capture Time Retrieval 

**Authors**: Serhii Matsyshyn, Oleksii Mytnyk, Tymur Krasnianskyi

**Published**: 1 September 2024. Performed in OS-2023.

[Download the preprint in PDF.](/files/2024-08-26-preprints-2024-1/PR2024_08_draft_05.pdf)

**Abstract**: *We present a series of steps that allow for the injection of high-precision timestamps. Most CCTV cameras do not provide an absolute timestamp of the frame, which is crucial in solving real-time computer vision tasks. A common approach for timestamp estimation is to subtract the average delay from the frame retrieval time on the client's side. However, the delay accumulates from many stages of image processing and varies substantially. Whereas our approach is to inject timestamps into the video stream on the camera's side. Our customized software provides highly accurate results: the standard deviation of the difference between predicted and actual frame capture time is 10ms. Furthermore, video stream delay decreased from 200ms to 115ms on average.*

Specifically, the focus of this report will be on the hardware aspect related to power supply. The investigation aims to understand the impact of a camera operating with a noisy power supply and seeks to implement software-based solutions to improve the overall image quality. For this project, we used a Raspberry Pi image sensor.*
